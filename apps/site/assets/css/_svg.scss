//
// SVG CLASSES
//
// This file should ONLY be used to manipulate fills and strokes for SVG icons
// that have been added using &SiteWeb.ViewHelpers.svg/1. All rules in this file
// should be namespaced under the ".c-svg__#{ICON-NAME}" class added by that
// function; inside of those namespaces, you may target elements and breakpoints
// as needed. Do not use classes or IDs as selectors inside of these namespaces.
//
// Be aware that these nested selectors have a higher specificity than our normal
// selectors, which is why it's very important to limit these rules to only
// fills and strokes. Any other styling for these SVGs (positioning, width,
// height, etc.) should be handled elsewhere.

  display: inline-block;
